        <p>
            I am a student about to start studying Computer Science at Dundee University and a graduate of Web Development at Dundee and Angus college.  
            I am a flexible, hardworking and reliable person with good timekeeping. I am confident, friendly, and polite and good at building new relationships. 
            I am always willing to learn and develop new skills. I have been involved scouting for many years and it has helped me to develop many important life 
            skills. Through scouting I have earned many badges, such as my first aid badges up to level 3. I have also planned and ran group nights, 
            including the budgeting and getting the resources. During my time at college, I was a class rep, listening to my peers concerns and attend meetings 
            with other class reps to help raise these points. I was a finalist for the Lord Provost McManus Citizenship Award 2024, having been nominated by my 
            head teacher for my friendly and helpful nature and my hard work, determination and commitment towards both my studies and the school community.
